Introducing **StudySync**, the ultimate solution for students struggling with procrastination and time management. With StudySync, you’re not just working alone — you’re collaborating with friends to keep each other accountable and on top of academic tasks. Sign in easily with Google, add study buddies, and view each other's to-do lists. StudySync promotes productivity by sending personalized reminders as deadlines approach.

If you start slipping behind, your friends will be notified and given the chance to encourage you to get back on track. Whether it's a gentle nudge or a playful reminder like “Bruh, just do it!”, StudySync keeps procrastination at bay through accountability and connection.

But that’s not all — StudySync also helps strengthen connections with your friends. Imagine seeing that both you and your study buddy are struggling with the same assignment.
